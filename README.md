<h3> Result </h3>

After ML is done, use the NN model to see the result.

<h3> Further Testing with Random Position </h3>

Above tutorial cannot cover the case when the goal is at different position. In this case, I will ML the cube to reach to the goal that is not in same position in every episode.

<h3> Result </h3>

Now, eventhoug the goal position is different everytime, we can see the cube is moving toward the goal.
